Date Submitted to NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Committee: November 16, 2025

This repository contains my argument for the inclusion of the University of Delaware Blue Hens as an at-large team in the 2025 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament. The Blue Hens finished the regular season 12-1-3, good for one of the best seasons in program history. Delaware lost in the semifinals of the Summit League conference tournament to the University of Missouri-Kansas City Kangaroos, a team that made the NCAA tournament. My assignment was to argue why the Delaware Blue Hens deserved one of the 26 at-large bids for the tournament. I started by analyzing Delaware's schedule, identifying individual awards given to student-athletes, and displaying the team's accomplishments and recognitions. Next, I used metrics such as goal differential, scoring offense, and shutout percentage to compare the Blue Hens to other teams fighting for at-large spots. Finally, I looked at recent at-large teams that found success in the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament that had similar performances to the 2025 Blue Hens prior to their selection for the tournament. My finalized report was submitted on behalf of the University of Delaware Athletic Department to the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Committee on Sunday, November 16th, 2025.
